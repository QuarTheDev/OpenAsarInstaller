### What does this do?

This is a shell script for your Linux system that automatically replaces the `app.asar` file for you, so you don't have to download it and replace manually.

### ✨ **Installation** ✨

Open your terminal of choice and copy the following script into the terminal:
```
bash <(curl -sSL https://github.com/QuarTheDev/OpenAsarInstaller/raw/main/installer.sh)
```
Then, after a few moments, your stock `app.asar` will automatically be replaced with OpenAsar.

<sup>⚠️ **This will automatically close Discord if it's already running.**</sup>

### Uninstall:

Open your terminal of choice and copy the following script into the terminal:
```
bash <(curl -sSL https://github.com/QuarTheDev/OpenAsarInstaller/raw/main/uninstaller.sh)
```
After a few moments, OpenAsar will be removed and the stock `app.asar` will be reinstalled.

<sup>⚠️ **This will automatically close Discord if it's already running.**</sup>
